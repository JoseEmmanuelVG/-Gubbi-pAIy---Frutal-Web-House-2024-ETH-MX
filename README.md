# Gubbi: Financial Module for Unbanked Rural Communities

## Overview

**Gubbi** is a full-stack demo application designed to empower rural, unbanked communities by providing them access to modern financial services. It leverages blockchain technology and voice-assisted navigation in indigenous dialects, helping to break down language, technology, and financial access barriers.

With Gubbi, we are not just providing a service, but also helping to connect rural communities to the global economy, ensuring that their physical assets and efforts are recognized with the value they deserve.

This repository contains the **Gubbi** demo application built using **React** (with Tailwind CSS) on the frontend and **Node.js** on the backend. It connects to Web3 services through **Ether.js**, with plans to integrate other blockchains and smart contracts in the near future.

## Core Features

- **Financial Inclusion**: Aimed at non-banked individuals in rural areas with support for voice navigation in indigenous languages.
- **Asset Tokenization**: Real-world assets (RWA) can be tokenized, giving users access to modern financial services such as staking and loans.
- **Multichain Support**: Cross-chain transactions and services, with core wallets integrated on various mainnets.
- **Remittance Services**: Facilitate international remittances in a simple and low-cost manner.

## Application Flow

The **Gubbi Wallet** module consists of several interconnected processes, as outlined in the flow diagram:

1. **AI Transaction Explorer**: Initiates the transaction flow. User requests to send money or services.
2. **Module Manager (Smart Contract Interaction)**: Verifies the transaction request and handles the transfer of USD or tokens.
3. **Core Mainnet Integration**: Core wallets (e.g., $CORE) communicate with external mainnets (e.g., Ethereum) through business-to-business (B2B) protocols.
4. **Smart Process**: In charge of processing the transaction, validating rates, fees, and communicating with multiple chains (ETH and Core).
5. **Approval System**: Users (identified by unique wallet addresses) are validated, ensuring all transactions are secure and meet the platform's criteria.
6. **Asset Management**: Includes liquidity pools (LP), automated market makers (AMM), and swap functionalities for asset exchange.

### Detailed Process Breakdown:

- **Step 1**: A user initiates a transaction via the **AI Transac Explorer**, requesting a transfer of funds or assets.
- **Step 2-8**: The **Module Manager** interacts with external services to validate the request and initiate the transfer.
- **Step 9-10**: Users are approved based on ID validation, after which they can receive USD or tokens directly in their wallets.
- **Step 11-14**: The Core Mainnet and Ethereum Mainnet facilitate the asset transfer and communication for smooth cross-chain operations, utilizing **AMM** and **Swap** services for asset exchange between USD, ETH, and Core assets.

## Use Cases

1. **Remittances**: Users can send money (USD or tokens) across borders, utilizing Gubbi's multicurrency and multichain support.
2. **Asset Tokenization**: Rural assets, such as land or produce, can be tokenized and used for loans or staking on the platform.
3. **Cross-Border Payments**: Seamless and low-cost payments using blockchain, with automatic rate conversion.
4. **Staking and Loans**: Users can stake their tokenized assets or take loans using real-world assets as collateral.

## Services Provided

- **Multichain Payments**: For goods and services across different blockchains.
- **Tokenization of Real-World Assets (RWA)**: Allows users to convert their physical assets into digital tokens.
- **Remittance Collection**: Facilitates the collection and transfer of remittances in a simple and cost-effective way.
- **Multichain Transfers**: Cross-chain asset and fund transfers with support for various cryptocurrencies and tokens.
- **Staking**: Users can stake their assets to earn rewards or receive loans.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js, handling server-side logic, smart contract interactions, and asset management.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ether.js for Web3 connections, interacting with Ethereum, Core Mainnet, and potentially other networks like **Avalanche (Avax)**.
- **AI and Cloud Services**: AI-driven transaction navigation, with future plans for token integration such as **$Gubbi**.

## How It Works: Example Transaction

- **User Request**: "Send 10 pesos to Juan"
- **Conversion**: Converts from account `000123`, ensuring a minimum of 10 USD equivalent is sent.
- **Exchange Rate**: Gubbi calculates the exchange rate (e.g., 1 USD = 17.01 MXN).
- **Transfer**: Sends the total of $10 USD to Juanâ€™s wallet (`0xF2A...B3680`).
- **Fees**: Transparent breakdown of fees and tariffs.

## Roadmap

1. **Hackathon Integration**: Development begins at ETH MX hackathons to refine smart contract modules and Web3 interaction.
2. **AI and Voice Navigation**: Further development of AI-assisted navigation to support more dialects and language processing.
3. **Tokenization Expansion**: Expanding support for asset tokenization, adding new real-world assets.
4. **Launch of $Gubbi Token**: Native token launch to provide ecosystem rewards, staking, and other DeFi services.


**Gubbi** aims to democratize financial services, particularly for those in rural and underserved areas. By integrating modern blockchain technology with accessible user interfaces and AI, Gubbi empowers users to participate in the global economy without the traditional barriers.
